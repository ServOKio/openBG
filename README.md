This plugin allows you to change your banner without nitro. Your banner will be seen by users who have also installed this plugin. Original: [UserBG](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg)

### How can I change my banner ?
**Answer**: 
1. You need to upload your banner image to any of the discord channels and copy the image address.
2. Follow the link [https://servokio.ru/openbg](https://servokio.ru/openbg) and authorize the application. What for? We need your ID in order to understand who exactly needs to change the banner.
3. Paste the link to the image into the form and if the frame is green, then everything is fine
4. Click "Send". That's it, you've changed the banner !

(according to the standard, banners are updated every hour, but you can simply click the "Redownload database" button in the plugin settings)
